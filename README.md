## About the Project 
1. [Dataset used](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tDCCxB7qZNjVKcltWzYb7QAFtJV17saW/view?usp=share_link) <br />
2. Models Used <br />
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor 
- SVM 
- Random Forest Regressor 
- XGB Regressor <br />
 ##### The best accuracy was obtained using Random Forest with RScore of 88% and MAE score of 16%
 
 ## Future Scope <br />
 Accuracy can be improved by using a larger dataset and more hyperparameter tuning
